## Clustring project

### Overview
This project used all techninques of clustring in scikit learn library with example of data, we used the latest version of scikit learn.

### Notebooks
---
The Notebook folder contains the clustring algorithms that used in this project:

* [X] K-means
* [X] MiniBatch-K-means
* [X] Bisecting-K-means
* [X] Hierarchical-Clustering(Agglomerative)
* [X] DBscan
* [X] Mean-shift
* [X] Optics
* [X] Spectral-clustering
* [X] Spectral-biclustering
* [X] Affinity-Propagation
* [X] HDBSCAN

---
Each clustring algorithm was Evaluated with the following metrics:

* [X] Silhouette Score
* [X] Calinski-Harabasz Score
* [X] Davies-Bouldin Score
