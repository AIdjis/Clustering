## Clustring project

### Overview
---
This project explores a variety of clustering techniques using the latest version of the `scikit-learn` library. Each algorithm is demonstrated with example datasets, providing practical insights into how clustering can be applied across different scenarios.
---
### Notebooks
---
The `Notebooks` folder contains implementations of the following clustering algorithms:

* [X] K-means
* [X] MiniBatch-K-means
* [X] Bisecting-K-means
* [X] Hierarchical-Clustering(Agglomerative)
* [X] DBscan
* [X] Mean-shift
* [X] Optics
* [X] Spectral-clustering
* [X] Spectral-biclustering
* [X] Affinity-Propagation
* [X] HDBSCAN
* [X] Brich
* [X] Gaussian-mixture
* [X] Bayesian-Gaussian-Mixture
---
### Evaluation Metrics
---
Each clustering algorithm is evaluated using the following metrics to assess its performance:

* [X] Silhouette Score
* [X] Calinski-Harabasz Score
* [X] Davies-Bouldin Score
